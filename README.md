# Blueprint examples for DICE deployment tool

This repository contains various working examples of OASIS TOSCA
blueprints. To test and run them, use the [DICE Deployment Service][dds].

# Notes on content

There are currently blueprints for two platforms provided: for OpenStack and
FCO. Template part of the blueprints is identical, since DICE TOSCA library
abstracts away the differences in this part of the blueprint.

Platforms have different requirements when it comes to imports and inputs,
since each platform needs to be configured separately.
